Finn by Chase: A post-mortem
Last week Chase announced that it was turning off Finn by Chase after a little more than 12 months live nation-wide. A frequently cited example of digital-only banking, Finn was emblematic of a growing trend among the industry: new digital-only subsidiaries or brands targeting specific customer segments with a more modern banking experience. But these projects are difficult, often dealing with barriers such as:
•	Insufficient autonomy with its technology environment, built on top of the parent bank. 
•	Product offerings which aren’t differentiated enough to attract deposits.
•	Branding fails to establish trust against parent bank.
•	 Cultural resistance to support a venture viewed as cannibalistic.

Chase launched Finn as a pilot in St. Louis in October 2017, targeting millennials with a modern, no-fee experience. By June of 2018 it had gone national.  The tagline was “spend smarter, save better.” But as quickly and mysteriously as it had arrived, Finn by Chase was gone. 
It’s hard to say the digital-only brand “failed” in the traditional sense as it was only given a year to succeed. Still, launching a digital subsidiary is difficult, and Finn is by no means the first experiment in hit the market. I thought it would be interesting to look at Finn by Chase through the lens of some of these past attempts, some of the reasons why digital brands and subsidiary banks fail to gain adoption, and some of the challenges others in the industry looking to launch similar offerings are likely to face.
•	Technology platforms:  Many banks have launched digital-only propositions on the same technology as the main brand.  This is the route Chase took when launching Finn. The same backend can be useful in certain ways. Finn customers had access to checks, ATMs, teller systems, and the pre-existing infrastructure which Chase didn’t have to integrate from scratch.  The lead time to product launch also shortens as the new team does not have to build as many capabilities or procure new technology. But how innovative is a new brand on old technology?  How much flexibility and agility can be achieved on top of legacy? For many others this has been a serious roadblock.   
•	Product offerings: A big challenge new digital-only offerings often face is a lack of product depth which creates somewhat of a chicken and egg problem with customer acquisition.  Customers want their main bank to serve their needs, not just supply a checking account.  New banks or digital subsidiaries need more customers to attract funding and revenue to invest.  Deposits and savings accounts (the typical starting point) are low or negative margin products which almost always come without minimum balance requirements or fees.  Finn offered a great customer experience around tracking spending, saving, and paying friends, but it’s hard to say to what extent that was attracting customers.  Finn also only paid out a few basis points on savings, a fraction of the 200-300 basis points you can expect from some of the leading digital only savings options.
•	Branding/ brand image: There was a European bank years ago which launched a digital-only subsidiary for customers below a certain age and wealth threshold. These customers of the existing bank were moved over.  The idea was to offer simpler digital-first product offerings on top of financial management features like tracking spending or budgeting.  The intent backfired, and it ended up looking like a bank for the less wealthy.  Branding is tricky because new brands want to appear modern and “fintechy” while at the same time assuring customers that their money is safe (that this new venture isn’t two guys in a garage).  For institutions moving into adjacent verticals (e.g. Marcus by Goldman Sachs), this is an easy decision.  But Chase had an existing and modern retail digital offering. Why apply for Finn? Why not just apply for Chase? 
•	Cultural reluctance: For digital-subsidiaries and digital-only brands, cultural may be the real silent killer.  For a truly separate entity, banks are essentially funding and launching a competitor. Bankers may question the commitment to transformation of the main bank while it launches a parallel challenger. For digital-only brands, or products largely under the same organization structure, cultural and processes will be mostly identical.  Cannibalization across lines of business can become a concern.  Working with other internal product managers of LoB heads could prove challenging.  It’s hard to say if culture affected Finn, but it has been one of the industry’s biggest barriers to change.

In the end, what was Finn? Why was it given so short a life?  KPIs and customer acquisition may have been lower than expected.  A saturated market may have called into question its niche. But my guess is that this was ultimately an experiment in marketing / customer acquisition.  Finn was pushed largely in areas with a minimal Chase presence, and existing customers are being moved over to a Chase checking account with all the benefits retained (no fees, partner ATM network access, etc.).  Chase was likely learned a lot from running a separate, more iterative front-end design team (e.g. scaled agile, etc.), while still picking up additional customers in the process.
Regardless, its worth remembering that these initiatives from banks are largely experiments—efforts in innovation.  Successful innovation is about failing fast and taking those learnings to the next project.  Chase has consistently been at the forefront of digital banking and Finn is just one in a long line of experiments.  We look forward to what Chase has on the horizon.
